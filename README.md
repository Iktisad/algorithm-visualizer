Algorithms Lab — Sorting

This small demo is a starting point for interactive algorithm visualizations.

Files added:
- index.html — homepage + visualizer UI using TailwindCSS CDN
- js/sorting.js — minimal Bubble and Selection sort visualizer code

How to run
1. Open `sorting/index.html` in your browser. No build step required because Tailwind is loaded from CDN.

Notes
- The visualizer currently supports Bubble Sort and Selection Sort. More algorithms will be added.
- Adjust `Size` and `Speed` sliders and use `Randomize` to generate a new array.
